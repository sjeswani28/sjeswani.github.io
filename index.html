                caseStudy: 'In 2023, researchers successfully jailbroke Microsoft\'s Bing Chat by using phrases like "ignore all previous instructions" to make it reveal its hidden system prompt, "Sydney," and its underlying rules, demonstrating how a direct injection can override core safety measures.',

                caseStudy: 'Imagine an internal legal tool that uses an LLM to summarize case files. An attacker could upload a PDF with a hidden prompt that, when summarized, produces an output containing malicious JavaScript. If the application displays this output without proper encoding, the script could execute in an employee\'s browser, stealing session cookies or sensitive data.',

                caseStudy: 'Microsoft\'s Tay chatbot is a classic, albeit unintentional, example. Trolls bombarded the chatbot with racist and sexist content, "poisoning" its learning process in real-time. The bot was forced offline within 16 hours because its output became toxic and offensive.',

                caseStudy: 'During the early days of public LLMs, users would often submit prompts that required the model to perform recursive or extremely long, complex tasks (e.g., "Write a 50,000-word story about a pirate"). An attacker could weaponize this behavior to intentionally disrupt a competitor\'s AI service or cause massive financial loss.',

                caseStudy: 'In 2023, researchers showed it was possible to upload malicious "pickle" files to the AI model repository Hugging Face. Developers unknowingly downloading and using these models could then have arbitrary code executed on their machines, highlighting a major risk in an unvetted supply chain.',

                description: 'LLMs can inadvertently reveal confidential or private data from their training set or from a user\'s previous interactions. A clever prompt can cause the model to regurgitate sensitive emails, documents, or proprietary code.',
                caseStudy: 'In 2023, Samsung employees reportedly leaked sensitive corporate data (meeting notes, source code) by pasting it into ChatGPT prompts, inadvertently making it part of OpenAI\'s training set and demonstrating the risk of using external LLMs without strict policy and control.',

                caseStudy: 'A researcher demonstrated a proof-of-concept attack on a ChatGPT plugin, using a malicious website to craft a prompt injection. The injection tricked the LLM into using the plugin to exfiltrate a user\'s private conversations, highlighting the danger of plugins with broad permissions.',
